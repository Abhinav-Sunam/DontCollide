# DontCollide
A dynamic 2-player game built with PyGame, where players navigate a shared map to avoid collisions. Player 1 uses the WASD keys, while Player 2 controls their character with the Arrow keys. The objective is to explore the map while avoiding collisions with each other. Featuring smooth graphics, custom character sprites, and an interactive map, DontCollide delivers an exciting multiplayer challenge!

This project started as a simple experiment with two blocks moving on a screen. Over time, I kept adding features and polishing the game until it evolved into the engaging experience it is today.

How to Play

Player 1 Controls:
Move using the W, A, S, and D keys.
Player 2 Controls:
Move using the Arrow keys.
Avoid collisions and explore the map without entering the opponent's space.
